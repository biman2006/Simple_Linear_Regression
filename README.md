Implement Simple Linear Regression From Scratch

Python implementation of Simple Linear Regression from scratch for a 2D dataset. Calculates the best-fitting line using the mathematical formula—no ML libraries required.

Overview

Predicts a value y from x using a straight line:
y=m⋅x+b

Slope (m) and intercept (b) are calculated using:

m=sum{((X-X')(y-y'))/(X-X')^2}
b=y'-m.X'

## How It Works

Compute sums of x, y, x*y, x^2

Calculate slope (m) and intercept (b)

Predict y for given x

Plot the regression line with data points


Conclusion

A simple, formula-based linear regression for 2D data, perfect for understanding the basics of regression and visualizing linear relationships.
